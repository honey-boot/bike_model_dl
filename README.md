# 🚴‍♂️ Bike Rental Prediction (Deep Learning Regression with Streamlit)

This project predicts the number of bike rentals based on weather and time features using a deep learning regression model built with TensorFlow and deployed via Streamlit.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Predict hourly bike rental counts using historical data.
- **Dataset**: UCI Bike Sharing Dataset (`hour.csv`)
- **Model**: Deep Learning Regression model using Keras (TensorFlow backend)
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Web App

## 🧠 Features Used

The model uses the following 13 features:

- `season`, `yr`, `mnth`, `hr`, `holiday`, `weekday`, `workingday`, `weathersit`
- `temp`, `atemp`, `hum`, `windspeed`, `hour`
